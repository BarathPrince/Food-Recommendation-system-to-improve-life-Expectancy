# Food-Recommendation-system-to-improve-life-Expectancy
A global health aim is to increase life expectancy, and nutrition is essential for fostering longevity. Customary dietary guidelines are frequently general and might not adequately take into account each person's unique demands and preferences in terms of health. In this article, we offer a Health Data Food Recommendation System (HDFRS) that uses dietary intake data and individual health data to provide tailored food recommendations that are intended to increase life expectancy. Next, the most crucial elements for (HDFRS) are identified using feature selection approaches. Information from various sources, including genetic data, wearable technologies, food surveys, and electronic health records, is gathered and pre-processed through data acquisition. HDFRS models the links between food patterns, lifestyle factors, and health outcomes using supervised learning algorithms. Personalized food suggestions that support longevity and optimum health are based on this concept. After that, a variety of data mining algorithms, including as decision trees, naive Bayes, and support vector machines, are employed to classify individuals in order to determine their life expectancy. The performance of these algorithms is assessed using a range of evaluation criteria, including F1-score, accuracy, precision, and recall. The results demonstrate how well the proposed predictive model predicts people's life expectancy. The model also clarifies the significant risk variables that affect life expectancy. Further research could look into incorporating new data sources and advanced algorithms to improve the predictive model's accuracy and utility.
